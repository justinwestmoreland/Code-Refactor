# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

I was tasked with optimizing the code for Horiseon. 

Using semantic HTML5 tags and alt picture descriptions I was able to increase accessibility to their website.

Additionally, through the use of semantic tags I was able to condense some CSS stylings and remove reduncies. 

Broken hyperlinks are now functioning.
